 <h2>About me</h2>
 <p>
  <strong>Joseph Harris Semel</strong> was born in 1955 in New York. In 1961, his family relocated to California, where he grew up in Palm Springs.
 He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 1973 to 1975, followed by a year at the Greenberg Institute
 in Jerusalem focusing on Jewish studies. In 1977, Joseph attended California State University, where he earned a Bachelor's degree
 in Social Sciences.
 </p>
 <p>
 In 1977, Joseph visited Israel for the first time and married his wife, Shoshana. The couple returned to the United States in 1979,
 settling in Los Angeles for a year. Their first daughter, Stacey, was born in June 1980.
 From 1981 to 1983, they lived in San Francisco, and in 1983, they moved to Chicago.
 Their second daughter, Orit, was born in 1984, followed by their son, Asher, in 1988.
 </p>
 <p>
 Throughout their time in various cities, the family was actively involved in the Jewish community.
 All three children attended Jewish schools, spoke fluent Hebrew, and frequently visited Israel.
 In 1994, Joseph and his family made the significant decision to immigrate to Israel.
 They have been residing in Ashkelon, the city where Shoshana grew up, ever since.
 </p>
 <p>
 Joseph describes the move to Israel as the best decision they ever made, despite the initial challenges.
 He is proud of their successful integration into Israeli society. Currently, Joseph has been working for
 an international shipping company for 21 years. Shoshana worked as an English teacher until her retirement.
 Their three children honorably served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), and today they have five grandchildren,
 with the eldest currently serving in the IDF.
 </p>
 <p>
 Joseph expresses his deep love for Israel and his long-held desire to move to the country.
 He is proud to call Israel his home and considers himself a dedicated Zionist.
